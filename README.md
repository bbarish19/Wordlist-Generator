# Wordlist-Generator

Overview

The Wordlist Generator is a Python-based tool that creates customized wordlists based on user input. It incorporates variations such as leetspeak substitutions, capitalization changes, and appended mutations to enhance the generated wordlist. The program allows users to specify the desired length of the wordlist and automatically saves the generated words to a file.

Features

1. User Input-Based Wordlists: Users provide words, and the program generates variations.
2. Leetspeak Transformations: Converts words into common leetspeak alternatives.
3. Mutation Variants: Appends and prepends special characters and numbers.
4. Multi-Word Combinations: Generates permutations of user-provided words.
5. Customizable Wordlist Length: Users specify the number of words they want in the final list.
6. Persistent Storage: Wordlists are appended to a text file for future reference.
